# Moneyball Analysis: Player Replacement Strategy

## Project Overview
This project is based on the data-driven approach of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, as featured in the book "Moneyball" by Michael Lewis. The analysis aims to identify cost-effective player replacements using sabermetrics, focusing on batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. The goal is to help the Athletics maintain a competitive edge with limited resources by finding undervalued players who can match or exceed the contributions of key players lost in the offseason.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: For data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization
- **Data Visualization**: ggplot2 and other R libraries for clear insights

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains `Batting.csv` and `Salaries.csv`, with player performance and salary information.
- `Code/`: Includes `Moneyball.R` with all the R code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `Images/`: Any images or visualizations generated during the analysis will be stored here.

## Key Insights
- **Data-Driven Strategy**: Emphasis on sabermetrics allows for objective player evaluation, focusing on undervalued statistics like on-base percentage and slugging percentage.
- **Budget Efficiency**: Highlights players who can replace key contributors (e.g., Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon) within the constraints of a small-market team budget.
- **Long-Term Impact**: The analysis provides insights into maintaining competitiveness through efficient resource allocation, which has implications for sports management beyond baseball.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the R script (`Moneyball.R`) in RStudio or any compatible R environment.
3. Ensure necessary R packages (like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`) are installed.
4. Review the analysis results, visualizations, and player recommendations.
